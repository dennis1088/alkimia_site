1.0.2 - Fixed calls to jQuery UI. Now slider works when logged in as admin/editor. Content no longer disabled in edit mode as well. (Thanks to yamanoi and his add-on http://www.yamanoi.org/concrete5/download/extcontent/). Updated styles to override default jQuery UI styles.
1.0.1 - Updated Feature Image attribute name in view.php files. Made it so broken image tag doesn't show up if no Feature Image attribute has been set.
1.0 - Initial release
